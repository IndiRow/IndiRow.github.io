				Ludovico Maria Enrico Einaudi OMRI (Italian: [ludoˈviːko eiˈnaudi] (About this soundlisten);
				born 23 November 1955) is an Italian pianist and composer. Trained at the Conservatorio Verdi
				in Milan, Einaudi began his career as a classical composer, later incorporating other styles
				and genres such as pop, rock, folk, and world music.
				Einaudi has composed the scores for a number of films and television productions, including
				This Is England, The Intouchables, I'm Still Here, the TV miniseries Doctor Zhivago,

				After studying at the conservatory in Milan and subsequently with Berio,
				Einaudi spent several years composing in traditional forms, including several
				chamber and orchestral compositions. He soon garnered international attention
				and his music was performed at venues such as the Teatro alla Scala, the Tanglewood
				Festival, Lincoln Center, and the UCLA Center for Performing Arts.
				In the mid-1980s, he began to search for more personal expression in a series
				of works for dance and multimedia, and later for piano.
